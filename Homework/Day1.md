Questions:

1. Calculate the square root of 2 and take the square of it. Do you get 2? Why?

2. Evaluate the expressions `1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 == 4/3` and `1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 == 5/3`. One is true and the other one is false. Is Python crazy?

3. Write a string that is less than (`<`) any other string.

4. You will probably agree that $3 + (4 \times 5) = 23$ and $(3 + 4) \times 5 = 35$, and that the first identity can be written as $3 + 4 \times 5 = 23$, so the parenthesis is not needed, because it is understood that the product takes **precedence** over the sum. Now, what is `True or True and False`? Which operator has precedence, `and` or `or`? Another one: what is `not False or True`?

5. Which type have `True*True` and `True/True?` What is the rule?

6. Is `1 == True` true or false? What is the rule? 

7. Print the following strings with the function `print()`. Some of them will work and some will not. Can you explain the differences?

```
"Donald Trump and Joe Biden'

'''Donald Trump and Joe Biden'''

'Donald Trump 
and Joe Biden'

'Donald Trump\nand Joe Biden'

'Donald Trump \
and Joe Biden'

'''Donald Trump
and Joe Biden'''
```
