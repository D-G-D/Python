    "About the data: Hadley Wickham, Chief Scientist at RStudio, has collected airline on-time data for all flights\n",
    "departing New York City (LGA, JFK and EWR airports) in 2013. The data has been processed and trimmed for this exercise and is available on GitHub `https://github.com/D-G-D/Python/blob/main/Data/nyc_flights_H1_2013.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The csv file contains the following fields or columns:\n",
    "- `sched_dep_time`, the scheduled departure time of the flight, as yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss, in the NYC time zone.\n",
    "- `scheduled_duration`, the scheduled duration of the flight in minutes.\n",
    "- `dep_delay`, the departure delay in minutes, with negative time representing early departure.\n",
    "- `arr_delay`, the arrival delay in minutes, with negative time representing early arrival.\n",
    "- `origin`, the departure airport of the flight.\n",
    "- `dest`, the destination airport of the flight.\n",
    "- `distance`, the distance between origin and destination, in miles.\n",
    "- `carrier`, the two-letter carrier abbreviation.\n",
    "- `flight`, the flight number.\n",
    "- `tailnum`, the plane tail number.\n",
    "- `temp`, the temperature in Farenheit degrees at the scheduled departure time.\n",
    "- `humid`, the relative humidity in percentage at the scheduled departure time.\n",
    "- `wind_dir`, the wind direction in degrees at the scheduled departure time.\n",
    "- `wind_speed`, the wind speed in miles per hour at the scheduled departure time.\n",
    "- `wind_gust`, the wind gust in miles per hour at the scheduled departure time.\n",
    "- `precip`, the precipitation in inches at the scheduled departure time.\n",
    "- `pressure`, the sea level pressure in millibars at the scheduled departure time.\n",

    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "- The `destinations` list contains the destination airport (\"dest\" column) that the customer wants to fly to.\n",
